    <p>A wordpress site I made as part of my training in <a href="https://hopeworks.org/" title="Hopeworks Site"
            target="_blank" class="link">Hopeworks</a>, demonstrating my understanding of the
        wordpress platform and its unique quirks and limitations, as well as my understanding of modern web
        design.</p>
    <p>In this case I made a website centered around the Minecraft modding scene, an online community built
        around creating third-party addons for a popular video game. This page highlights some of my favorite
        creations, and details why I like them.</p>

    <p>Pixlr is a free equivalent to photoshop, and was what I used in my <a href="https://hopeworks.org/"
            title="Hopeworks Site" target="_blank" class="link">Hopeworks</a> training to practice and
        demonstrate my ability to edit images for use in various projects. I decided to base all of my projects
        off of a particular base image that I just found particularly funny.</p>

    <h2>This Portfolio!</h2>
    <iframe height="800" style="width: 100%;" scrolling="yes" title="Kylie's mod spotlight - Wordpress site"

    <p>This portfolio was made to be an addition to my portfolio in and of itself. I intentionally avoided using
        any site-building tools like wix or wordpress, and instead built my site entirely from scratch. It is
        hosted on a subdomain of my family's own domain, set up through InMotion hosting. </p>
    <p>I used the hosting services Cpanel interface, Github, and VScode to develop this site, and keep its files
        updated through the built-in version control software. I also made special effort to do my best to make
        sure the site was usable on a number of different devices, as it is made to scale with the width of the
        users screen.</p>
    <p>I know in the grand scheme of things, this site is nowhere near perfect, but I like to think it
        demonstrates a solid grasp of web development, especially considering I've developed it in less than a
        couple weeks, after only a couple months of training.</p>
