                    title="Hopeworks Site" target="_blank" class="link">Hopeworks</a>, demonstrating both my creativity
                and
                understanding of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The site is heavily stylized in the theme of late 90s web
                design, including the obnoxious animated ads.</p>
            <p>The site was essentially a creative writing project, written to be a fictional ghost hunting guide,
                written by a character from a game I'm working on in my free time.</p>

            <p>In this case I made a website centered around the Minecraft modding scene, an online community built
                around creating third-party addons for a popular video game. This page highlights some of my favorite
                creations, and details why I like them.</p>

                demonstrate my ability to edit images for use in various projects. I decided to base all of my projects
                off of a particular base image that I just found particularly funny.</p>

            <p>This portfolio was made to be an addition to my portfolio in and of itself. I intentionally avoided using
                any site-building tools like wix or wordpress, and instead built my site entirely from scratch. It is
                hosted on a subdomain of my family's own domain, set up through InMotion hosting. </p>
            <p>I used the hosting services Cpanel interface, Github, and VScode to develop this site, and keep its files
                updated through the built-in version control software. I also made special effort to do my best to make
                sure the site was usable on a number of different devices, as it is made to scale with the width of the
                users screen.</p>
            <p>I know in the grand scheme of things, this site is nowhere near perfect, but I like to think it
                demonstrates a solid grasp of web development, especially considering I've developed it in less than a
                couple weeks, after only a couple months of training.</p>
