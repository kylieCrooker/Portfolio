        <p>An intial stories page design and redesign for a client while at <a href="https://hopeworks.org/"
                title="Hopeworks Site" target="_blank" class="link">Hopeworks</a>, demonstrating both my general design
            skills and also my ability to adapt my designs to client feedback and requests.</p>
        <p>This stories page was designed to be simple, visually appealing, and evocative by featuring the individuals
            impacted by this organizations work directly, while letting the organization take a background role. In this
            particular case, all of the individuals listed are placeholders and stock images, as we didn't recieve any
            details or pictures from the client to use for these concept pages.</p>
        <p>For more details, please check out the linked imgur album for extensive explanations of the design as well as
            detailed screenshots</p>
