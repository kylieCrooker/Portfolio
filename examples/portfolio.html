        <p>This portfolio was made to be an addition to my portfolio in and of itself. I intentionally avoided using
            any site-building tools like wix or wordpress, and instead built my site entirely from scratch. It is hosted
            using inmotion on a subdomain of a family site.</p>
        <p>I used the hosting services Cpanel interface, Github, and VScode to develop this site, and keep its files
            updated through the built-in version control software. It also features responsive, mobile first web design.
