        <p>A sitemap and homepage design I made at <a href="https://hopeworks.org/" title="Hopeworks Site"
                target="_blank" class="link">Hopeworks</a> as part of client work for the Technology Learning
            Collaborative, an organization dedicated to providing education and resources on technology, as part of a
            goal of spreading tech literacy. </p>
        <p>I designed the homepage to roughly resemble the design styles of edutainment games and websites, as I felt
            that style would present an energy of positivity and learning that would make the clients site seem inviting
            and enjoyable to read.</p>
        <p>For more details, please check out the linked imgur album for extensive explanations of the design as well as
            detailed screenshots</p>
