        <p>While at Hopeworks I was tasked with working on some subpages for the Youth Action nonprofit, as part of a
            site redesign for them. I was originally tasked with just the "Who we are" subpage for the About Us section,
            but the quality of my work led to my supervisor asking me to contribute more pages to the project.</p>
        <p>So I ended up designing a total of three pages for this project, while adhering to the design requests and
            notes from the client, making sure the subpages I created didn't stray too far from the main design, yet
            were still more than just copy-paste clones of each other.</p>
