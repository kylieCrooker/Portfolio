    <div class="example-text">
        <p>This sample site was designed as a template for Hopeworks web development clients that were looking for an
            online commerce platform. Though more specifically styled with a hobby shop in mind, the general design and
            layout could apply to any number of clients. </p>
        <p>The intention of the design was to give the impression of a home grown, community focused company, to help
            users feel like they can be trusted to keep their best interests in mind. In order to further emphasize
            this, an number of areas of the site draw attention to various gaming themed events that this fictional
            company hosts.</p>
