            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I am a web design and development intern at <a href="https://hopeworks.org/" title="Hopeworks Site"
                    target="_blank" class="link">Hopeworks</a>, I have excelled in my education within the
                program by channeling my existing knowledge of web development, and my ecstatic passion for tech as a
                whole. I believe that doing what you love in service of the world you want to create is the most
                important thing a person can do with their lives.
            </p>
            <p>I have put in a great deal of effort within the training program, and this has shown in the fact that
                I
                have completed the majority of the modules within under a month, all while maintaining my excellent
                standard of work, and also managing to be awarded trainee of the week within my first month at the
                company. Currently I am working on my portfolio module, making sure to take my time to ensure it
                presents my skills in the most accurate and impactful way, this is all part of my eventual goal to
                move
                up within the company and secure an internship with one of the professional teams.</p>
            <p>I have a solid foundation of the scripting languages HTML, CSS, Javascript, Zenscript, and JSON. In
                addition, I also have a basic understanding of the programs Excel, Visual studio Code, Wordpress,
                ArcGIS, notepad++, Pixlr, and the Google suite. I am also a proud bearer of the Eagle scout rank
                from my
                time in scouting.</p>
            <p>When I am not working on advancing my career in the tech industry, I can still often be found working
                directly with tech, either playing video games, participating in discussion forums online, or even
                coding in my spare time for personal projects. Outside of tech, I enjoy tabletop gaming, hiking, and
                hanging out with my supportive girlfriend and our two cats.</p>
