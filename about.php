            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>My name is Kylie, and I am a Web design and development intern at <a href="https://hopeworks.org/"
                    title="Hopeworks Site" target="_blank" class="link">Hopeworks</a>, where I have met and
                exceeded production goals set out for me, while being driven by my passion for technology and design. I
                believe that user-friendly design is the cornerstone of any functional website or application, and that
                doing what you love in service of the world you want to create is the most important thing you can do
                with your life.</p>
            <p>I started at hopeworks in their training program, and completed the entire course in less than a month,
                well ahead of the expected schedule, all while maintaining an excellent standard of work. In addition to
                this, I received a reward for trainee of the month during my time in the program, as well as several
                commendations for the work I did in the program.
            </p>
            <p>In my current position, I am responsible for the design of several client pages and site templates,
                making sure they follow the standards of quality laid out for me, and that they adhere to UI/UX
                standards, as well following accessibility guidelines. My style of design focuses on a lack of visual
                clutter, while still maintaining some amount of subtle flair that makes sites feel alive, while still
                being easy to navigate and not putting strain on potentially lower end hardware or mobile devices.
            </p>
            <p>My core languages are CSS, HTML, and Javascript, and I have a solid foundation in Zenscript, PHP, and
                SCSS. In addition, I have a good amount of experience with Elementor, Figma, VS Code, The Google suite,
                and Gnu Image Manipulation Program. I am also a proud bearer of the Eagle scout rank from my time in the
                BSA.
            </p>
            <p>When I am not working on advancing my career in the tech industry, I can still often be found working
                directly with tech, either playing video games, participating in discussion forums online, or even
                coding in my spare time for personal projects. Outside of tech, I enjoy tabletop gaming, hiking, and
                hanging out with my supportive girlfriend and our two cats.
