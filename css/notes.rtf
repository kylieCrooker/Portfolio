Notes on elements of design in my portfolio:
    The progress bar is responsive to whether or not the sidemenu is open, and adjusts its size accordingly.
    The horizontal menu is responsive to mobile and only shows up if the screen is within the paramaters for desktop.
    Website is designed mobile-first, with desktop focused design choices only being active if the display is larger than a certain value.
