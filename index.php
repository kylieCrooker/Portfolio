                    developer, Aspiring IT
                    technician, and tech hobbyist, looking to find my place in the industry.</h2>
                <p>My current skillset includes a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I also know my way

                    fundamental part of my life and journey, and is a major factor in me becoming who I am today.
